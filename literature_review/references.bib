  abstract = {In addition to vehicle control, drivers often perform secondary tasks that impede driving. Reduction of driver distraction is an important challenge for the safety of intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, a methodology for the detection and evaluation of driver distraction while performing secondary tasks is described and an appropriate hardware and a software environment is offered and studied. The system includes a model of normal driving, a subsystem for measuring the errors from the secondary tasks, and a module for total distraction evaluation. A new machine learning algorithm defines driver performance in lane keeping and speed maintenance on a specific road segment. To recognize the errors, a method is proposed, which compares normal driving parameters with ones obtained while conducting a secondary task. To evaluate distraction, an effective fuzzy logic algorithm is used. To verify the proposed approach, a case study with driver-in-the-loop experiments was carried out, in which participants performed the secondary task, namely chatting on a cell phone. The results presented in this research confirm its capability to detect and to precisely measure a level of abnormal driver performance.},

  abstract = {There are three reasons for giving serious consideration to technological countermeasures against driver fatigue: 1, fatigue is a persistent occupational hazard for professional drivers; 2, some professional drivers are under considerable pressure to reach their scheduled destination, in spite of feeling drowsy; 3, fatigue adversely affects an individual's ability to assess their own fitness to continue driving. However, there are two reasons for exercising caution in implementing technological countermeasures: 1, their reliability under real traffic conditions is largely unproven; 2, they could be used by unscrupulous drivers to support the continuation of journeys that should have been terminated because of human impairment. This paper draws on the findings of research into the origins, symptoms and development of human fatigue, and on recent research into driver-support systems, to assess the prospects for implementations of technological countermeasures against driver fatigue in the foreseeable future.},

Previous methods based on face detection or colour-based image segmentation are less reliable in a hospital setting. In this paper, we develop a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting the presence of a patient and segmenting the patient's skin regions. The multi-task model has a shared core network with two branches: a segmentation branch which was implemented using a fully convolutional network, and a classification branch which was implemented using global average pooling. The whole network was trained using images from a clinical study conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe hospital, Oxford, UK. Our model can produce accurate results and is robust to changes in different skin tones, pose variations, lighting variations, and routine interaction of clinical staff.},

Based on a driving simulator platform equipped with several sensors, we have designed a framework to acquire sensor data, process and extract features related to fatigue and distraction. Ultimately the features from the different sources are fused to infer the driver's state of inattention. In our work, we extract audio, color video, depth map, heart rate, and steering wheel and pedals positions. We then process the signals according to three modules, namely the vision module, audio module, and other signals module. The modules are independent from each other and can be enabled or disabled at any time. Each module extracts relevant features and, based on hidden Markov models, produces its own estimation of driver fatigue and distraction. Lastly, fusion is done using the output of each module, contextual information, and a Bayesian network. A dedicated Bayesian network was designed for both fatigue and distraction. The complementary information extracted from all the mod- ules allows a reliable estimation of driver inattention. Our experimental results show that we are able to detect fatigue with 98.4 \% accuracy and distraction with 90.5 \%.},

Driver inattention is a major factor in most traffic accidents. Research and development has actively been carried out for decades, with the goal of precisely determining the drivers' state of mind. In this paper, we summarize these approaches by dividing them into the following five different types of measures: 1) subjective report measures; 2) driver biological measures; 3) driver physical measures; 4) driving performance measures; and 5) hybrid measures. Among these approaches, subjective report measures and driver biological measures are not suitable under real driving conditions but could serve as some rough ground-truth indicators. The hybrid measures are believed to give more reliable solutions compared with single driver physical measures or driving performance measures, because the hybrid measures minimize the number of false alarms and maintain a high recognition rate, which promote the acceptance of the system. We also discuss some nonlinear modeling techniques commonly used in the literature.},

  abstract = {Driver inattention is one of the leading causes of vehicle crashes and incidents worldwide. Driver inattention includes driver fatigue leading to drowsiness and driver distraction, say due to use of cellphone or rubbernecking, all of which leads to a lack of situational awareness. Hitherto, techniques presented to monitor driver attention evaluated factors such as fatigue and distraction independently. However, in order to develop a robust driver attention monitoring system all the factors affecting driver's attention needs to be analyzed holistically. In this paper, we present AutoRate, a system that leverages front camera of a windshield-mounted smartphone to monitor driver's attention by combining several features. We derive a driver attention rating by fusing spatio-temporal features based on the driver state and behavior such as head pose, eye gaze, eye closure, yawns, use of cellphones, etc. We perform extensive evaluation of AutoRate on real-world driving data and also data from controlled, static vehicle settings with 30 drivers in a large city. We compare AutoRate's automatically-generated rating with the scores given by 5 human annotators. Further, we compute the agreement between AutoRate's rating and human annotator rating using kappa coefficient. AutoRate's automatically-generated rating has an overall agreement of 0.87 with the ratings provided by 5 human annotators on the static dataset.},

Meanwhile, driver fatigue is also influenced by some corresponding contextual information at a certain time. In such case, classifying driving state at each time slice separately from it in before and after time slices obviously has less meaning. Therefore, a dynamic fatigue detection model based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed in this paper. Driver fatigue can be estimated by this model in a probabilistic way using various physiological and contextual information. Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), and respiration signals were simultaneously recorded by wearable sensors and sent to computer by Bluetooth during the real driving. From these physiological information, fatigue likelihood can be achieved using kernel distribution estimate at different time sections. Contextual information offered by specific environmental factors were used as prior of fatigue. As time proceeds, the posterior of fatigue can be gotten dynamically by this HMM-based fatigue recognition method. Based on the results of the method in this paper, it shows that it provides an effective way in detecting driver fatigue.},

First, we introduce the core block to extract temporal dependencies from EEG signals. Then, we employ dense layers to fuse spatial features and realize classification. The developed network could automatically learn valid features from EEG signals, which outperforms the classical two-step machine learning algorithms. Importantly, we carry out fatigue driving experiments to collect EEG signals from eight subjects being alert and fatigue states. Using 2800 samples under within-subject splitting, we compare the effectiveness of ESTCNN with eight competitive methods. The results indicate that ESTCNN fulfills a better classification accuracy of 97.37\% than these compared methods. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal structure of this framework advantages in computational efficiency and reference time, which allows further implementations in the brain-computer interface online systems.},

A confidence measure was used to filter out less likely word hypotheses from the ASR's output. In this paper we restricted our analysis to dealing with out-of-vocabulary words.

  abstract = {This SAE Recommended Practice describes motor vehicle driving automation systems that perform part or all of the dynamic driving task (DDT) on a sustained basis. It provides a taxonomy with detailed definitions for six levels of driving automation, ranging from no driving automation (level 0) to full driving automation (level 5), in the context of motor vehicles (hereafter also referred to as ``vehicle'' or ``vehicles'') and their operation on roadways. These level definitions, along with additional supporting terms and definitions provided herein, can be used to describe the full range of driving automation features equipped on motor vehicles in a functionally consistent and coherent manner. ``On-road'' refers to publicly accessible roadways (including parking areas and private campuses that permit public access) that collectively serve users of vehicles of all classes and driving automation levels (including no driving automation), as well as motorcyclists, pedal cyclists, and pedestrians. The levels apply to the driving automation feature(s) that are engaged in any given instance of on-road operation of an equipped vehicle. As such, although a given vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system that is capable of delivering multiple driving automation features that perform at different levels, the level of driving automation exhibited in any given instance is determined by the feature(s) that are engaged. This document also refers to three primary actors in driving: the (human) user, the driving automation system, and other vehicle systems and components. These other vehicle systems and components (or the vehicle in general terms) do not include the driving automation system in this model, even though as a practical matter a driving automation system may actually share hardware and software components with other vehicle systems, such as a processing module(s) or operating code. The levels of driving automation are defined by reference to the specific role played by each of the three primary actors in performance of the DDT and/or DDT fallback. ``Role'' in this context refers to the expected role of a given primary actor, based on the design of the driving automation system in question and not necessarily to the actual performance of a given primary actor. For example, a driver who fails to monitor the roadway during engagement of a level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) system still has the role of driver, even while s/he is neglecting it. Active safety systems, such as electronic stability control and automated emergency braking, and certain types of driver assistance systems, such as lane keeping assistance, are excluded from the scope of this driving automation taxonomy because they do not perform part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis and, rather, merely provide momentary intervention during potentially hazardous situations. Due to the momentary nature of the actions of active safety systems, their intervention does not change or eliminate the role of the driver in performing part or all of the DDT, and thus are not considered to be driving automation. It should, however, be noted that crash avoidance features, including intervention-type active safety systems, may be included in vehicles equipped with driving automation systems at any level. For Automated Driving System (ADS) features (i.e., levels 3-5) that perform the complete DDT, crash avoidance capability is part of ADS functionality.},

To address this, we present a novel method for the extraction of respiration from camera-based measurements taken from the top-view of an incubator. A total of 107 events from 30 neonatal admissions were annotated by three clinical reviewers as either true cessations of breathing (physiologically relevant) or false (artefact-related). The events were divided into two independent groups for training and validation and our algorithm was trained to classify true cessations. We achieved a good classification performance with 9 out of 10 cessations and 7 out of 10 artefactual events correctly identified in the training set, and with 7 out of 10 cessations and 34 out of 44 artefactual events correctly identified in the out-of-sample test set.

Drowsiness detection based on biological signals is being employed in precautionary personal safety. Autonomous Nervous System (ANS) activity can be measured non-invasively from the Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) signal obtained from photoplethysmography signal (PPG), that comprises alterations during, relaxation, extreme fatigue and drowsiness episodes. Our hypothesis is that these variations manifest on PRV. In this work we develop an on-line detector of drowsiness based on PRV analysis. The databases have been collected with the aid of an external observer who decides upon each minute of the recordings as drowsy or awake, and constitutes our data base.},

It will be shown that many techniques actually measure mechanical displacement, either on the body surface and/or inside the body. However, there are also techniques like capacitive electrocardiogram or bioimpedance that reflect electrical activity or passive electrical properties or thermal properties (infrared thermography). In addition, photopleythysmographic methods depend on optical properties (like scattering and absorption) of biological tissues and\&mdash;mainly\&mdash;blood. As all unobtrusive sensing modalities are always fragile and at risk of being contaminated by disturbances (like motion, rapidly changing environmental conditions, triboelectricity), the scope of the paper includes a survey on redundant sensor arrangements. Finally, this review also provides an overview of automotive demonstrators for vital sign monitoring.},

  abstract = {Driver cognitive distraction (e.g., hand-free cell phone conversation) can lead to unapparent, but detrimental, impairment to driving safety. Detecting cognitive distraction represents an important function for driver distraction mitigation systems. We developed a layered algorithm that integrated two data mining methods\textemdash Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and supervised clustering\textemdash to detect cognitive distraction using eye movement and driving performance measures. In this study, the algorithm was trained and tested with the data collected in a simulator-based study, where drivers drove either with or without an auditory secondary task. We calculated 19 distraction indicators and defined cognitive distraction using the experimental condition (i.e., ``distraction'' as in the drives with the secondary task, and ``no distraction'' as in the drives without the secondary task). We compared the layered algorithm with previously developed DBN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The results showed that the layered algorithm achieved comparable prediction performance as the two alternatives. Nonetheless, the layered algorithm shortened training and prediction time compared to the original DBN because supervised clustering improved computational efficiency by reducing the number of inputs for DBNs. Moreover, the supervised clustering of the layered algorithm revealed rich information on the relationship between driver cognitive state and performance. This study demonstrates that the layered algorithm can capitalize on the best attributes of component data mining methods and can identify human cognitive state efficiently. The study also shows the value in considering the supervised clustering method as an approach to feature reduction in data mining applications.},

  abstract = {Driving while fatigued is just as dangerous as drunk driving and may result in car accidents. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been studied recently for the detection of driver drowsiness. However, the detection reliability has been lower than anticipated, because the HRV signals of drivers were always regarded as stationary signals. The wavelet transform method is a method for analyzing non-stationary signals. The aim of this study is to classify alert and drowsy driving events using the wavelet transform of HRV signals over short time periods and to compare the classification performance of this method with the conventional method that uses fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based features. Based on the standard shortest duration for FFT-based short-term HRV evaluation, the wavelet decomposition is performed on 2-min HRV samples, as well as  1-min and 3-min samples for reference purposes. A receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier are used for feature selection and classification, respectively. The ROC analysis results show that the wavelet-based method performs better than the FFT-based method regardless of the duration of the HRV sample that is used. Finally, based on the real-time requirements for driver drowsiness detection, the SVM classifier is trained using eighty FFT and wavelet-based features that are extracted from 1-min HRV signals from four subjects. The averaged leave-one-out (LOO) classification performance using wavelet-based feature is 95\% accuracy, 95\% sensitivity, and 95\% specificity. This is better than the FFT-based results that have 68.8\% accuracy, 62.5\% sensitivity, and 75\% specificity. In addition, the proposed hardware platform is inexpensive and easy-to-use.},

The proposed system firstly extracts approximate entropy (ApEn)featuresfromfixedslidingwindowsonreal-timesteeringwheelanglestimeseries. Afterthat, this system linearizes the ApEn features series through an adaptive piecewise linear fitting using a given deviation. Then, the detection system calculates the warping distance between the linear features series of the sample data. Finally, this system uses the warping distance to determine the drowsiness state of the driver according to a designed binary decision classifier. The experimental data were collected from 14.68 h driving under real road conditions, including two fatigue levels: ``wake'' and ``drowsy''. The results show that the proposed system is capable of working online with an average 78.01\% accuracy, 29.35\% false detections of the ``awake'' state, and 15.15\% false detections of the ``drowsy'' state. The results also confirm that the proposed method based on SWA signal is valuable for applications in preventing traffic accidents caused by driver fatigue.},

  abstract = {In conditionally automated driving, drivers do not have to monitor the road, whereas in partially automated driving, drivers have to monitor the road permanently. We evaluated a dynamic allocation of monitoring tasks to human and automation by providing a monitoring request (MR) before a possible take-over request (TOR), with the aim to better prepare drivers to take over safely and efficiently. In a simulator-based study, an MR + TOR condition was compared with a TOR-only condition using a within-subject design with 41 participants. In the MR + TOR condition, an MR was triggered 12 s before a zebra crossing, and a TOR was provided 7 s after the MR onset if pedestrians crossing the road were detected. In the TOR-only condition, a TOR was provided 5 s before the vehicle would collide with a pedestrian if the participant did not intervene. Participants were instructed to perform a self-paced visual-motor non-driving task during automated driving. Eye tracking results showed that participants in the MR + TOR condition responded to the MR by looking at the driving environment. They also exhibited better take-over performance, with a shorter response time to the TOR and a longer minimum time to collision as compared to the TOR-only condition. Subjective evaluations also showed advantages of the MR: participants reported lower workload, higher acceptance, and higher trust in the MR + TOR condition as compared to the TOR-only condition. Participants' reliance on automation was tested in a third drive (MR-only condition), where automation failed to provide a TOR after an MR. The MR-only condition resulted in later responses (and errors of omission) as compared to the MR + TOR condition. It is concluded that MRs have the potential to increase safety and acceptance of automated driving as compared to systems that provide only TORs. Drivers' trust calibration and reliance on automation need further investigation.},

  abstract = {The measurement of human vital signs is a highly important task in a variety of environments and applications. Most notably, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a versatile signal that could indicate various physical and psychological conditions, from signs of life to complex mental states. The measurement of the ECG relies on electrodes attached to the skin to acquire the electrical activity of the heart, which imposes certain limitations. Recently, due to the advancement of wireless technology, it has become possible to pick up heart activity in a contactless manner. Among the possible ways to wirelessly obtain information related to heart activity, methods based on mm-wave radars proved to be the most accurate in detecting the small mechanical oscillations of the human chest resulting from heartbeats. In this paper, we presented a method based on a continuous-wave Doppler radar coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN) to detect heartbeats as individual events. To keep the method computationally simple, the ANN took the raw radar signal as input, while the output was minimally processed, ensuring low latency operation ({$<$}1 s). The performance of the proposed method was evaluated with respect to an ECG reference (``ground truth'') in an experiment involving 21 healthy volunteers, who were sitting on a cushioned seat and were refrained from making excessive body movements. The results indicated that the presented approach is viable for the fast detection of individual heartbeats without heavy signal preprocessing.},

As the Tesla approached a paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the left exit ramp to State Route 85 (SR-85), the vehicle moved to the left and entered the gore. It continued traveling through the gore and struck a previously damaged and nonoperational crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph. The impact rotated the SUV counterclockwise and caused the front body structure to separate from the rear of the vehicle. The Tesla was involved in subsequent collisions with two other vehicles, a 2010 Mazda 3 and a 2017 Audi A4. The Tesla's high-voltage battery was breached in the collision and a postcrash fire ensued. The driver was transported to a local hospital, where he died from blunt-force trauma injuries. The driver of the Mazda sustained minor injuries, and the driver of the Audi was uninjured.},

In this review, we have tried to delineate behavioral factors that collectively represent the principal cause of three out of five RTCs and contribute to the causation of most of the remaining. Although sharp distinctions are not always possible, a classification of behavioral factors is both necessary and feasible. Thus, behavioral factors can be distinguished as (i) those that reduce capability on a long-term basis (inexperience, aging, disease and disability, alcoholism, drug abuse), (ii) those that reduce capability on a short-term basis (drowsiness, fatigue, acute alcohol intoxication, short term drug effects, binge eating, acute psychological stress, temporary distraction), (iii) those that promote risk taking behavior with long-term impact (overestimation of capabilities, macho attitude, habitual speeding, habitual disregard of traffic regulations, indecent driving behavior, non-use of seat belt or helmet, inappropriate sitting while driving, accident proneness) and (iv) those that promote risk taking behavior with short-term impact (moderate ethanol intake, psychotropic drugs, motor vehicle crime, suicidal behavior, compulsive acts). The classification aims to assist in the conceptualization of the problem that may also contribute to behavior modification-based efforts.},

Regarding oculomotoric parameters, blink duration, delay of lid reopening, blink interval and standardised lid closure speed were identified as the best indicators of subjective as well as objective sleepiness. Saccadic parameters and fixation durations also showed specific changes with increasing sleepiness. Substantial inter-individual differences in all of these variables were illustrated. Oculomotoric parameters were linked to three different components of sleepiness while driving: a) deactivation; b) decreasing attention, resulting in disinhibition of spontaneous blinks and reflexive saccades; c) increasing attempts of self-activation.

  abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a direct indicator of hypertension, a dangerous and potentially deadly condition. Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Automobile manufacturers are developing increasingly sophisticated driving automation systems. Currently, the highest level of automation available on the market is SAE Level 2, which provides sustained assistance for both lateral and longitudinal vehicle control. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how drivers' perceptions of what behaviors secondary to driving are safe while a Level 2 system is operating vary by system name. Methods: A nationally representative telephone survey of 2005 drivers was conducted in 2018 with questions about behaviors respondents perceived as safe while a Level 2 driving automation system is in operation. Each respondent was asked about two out of five system names at random for a balanced study design. Results: The name ``Autopilot'' was associated with the highest likelihood that drivers believed a behavior was safe while in operation, for every behavior measured. There was less variation observed among the other four SAE Level 2 system names when compared with each other. A limited proportion of drivers had experience with advanced driver assistance systems and fewer of these reported driving a vehicle in which Level 2 systems were available. Drivers reported that they would consult a variety of sources for information on how to use a Level 2 system. Conclusions: The names of SAE Level 2 driving automation systems influence drivers' perceptions of how to use them, and the name ``Autopilot'' was associated with the strongest effect. While a name alone cannot properly instruct drivers on how to use a system, it is a piece of information and must be considered so that drivers are not misled about the correct usage of these systems. Practical Applications: Manufacturers, suppliers, and organizations regulating or evaluating SAE Level 2 automated driving systems should ensure that systems are named so as not to mislead drivers about their safe use.},

  abstract = {In an effort to better understand the impact of fatigue on commercial flight operations, we collected physiological and performance data from commercial flight crews performing simulated operations under both rested and fatigued conditions. The purpose of this research was 1) to evaluate the effects of varying levels of fatigue and workload on pilot performance and physiological responses, and 2) to determine whether any technology exists to detect symptoms of fatigue in real time. Thirty-two airline pilots were fitted with a variety of physiological measurement devices to measure characteristics that are affected by fatigue. Each crew of two pilots flew a ``rested'' and a ``fatigued'' session in a high-fidelity B-777 simulator. Crews were assigned to one of two flight scenarios: either one 6.5 hour ``long-haul'' flight or four consecutive 0.5 to 1.5 hour ``short haul'' flights. Subjective fatigue ratings accurately reflected the rested and fatigued conditions; however, performance on a psychomotor vigilance task did not vary significantly between rested and fatigued conditions or between short and long haul flights. Further, although physiological data allowed a general distinction between larger and smaller fatigue effects for most individuals, no single measurement device was found to reliably indicate fatigue levels with enough granularity to allow for useful fatigue detection. However, a statistical/machine learning model was constructed that was able to accurately categorize fatigued data for each individual pilots using that pilot's combined sensor data with a success rate greater than 95\%. It is probable that by optimizing the parameters of the model and improving the quality of sensor data, an algorithm-based solution to real-time fatigue detection can be developed. The applicability of this type of approach extends beyond the commercial flight deck to any work environment that requires multi-shift or other non-traditional scheduling.},

When we observe the time series of wavelet coefficients on each scale factor, the wavelet coefficients are affected by the respiration or the body motion on some scale factors. On the other hand, on some scale factor, the wavelet coefficients increase only when the heartbeats appear. We search the scale factor whose wavelet coefficients increase only when the heartbeats appear, in advance. In the learning phase, the subject sits still without body motion. We avoid using a pseudo frequency to obtain the heart rate. Instead, we use the time interval of each peak on the wavelet coefficients whose scale factor is decided in the learning phase. Thus, although the subject has body motion, the heartbeats are able to be detected. For the evaluation, four types of activities are tested. The R-R interval is used for the evaluation of heartbeat detection. As a result, we confirm that RMSE of the R-R interval reduced on all activities compared to the conventional method. Moreover, the RMSE of the R-R interval did not deteriorate when the distance between the Doppler radar and the subject becomes long.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of reported traffic accidents due to sudden deterioration in driver's physical condition has been increasing, it is expected to develop a system that prevents accidents even if physical condition suddenly changes while driving, or reduces damage through vehicle body control. For this purpose, it is necessary to detect sudden changes of the driver's physical condition, and research is being conducted widely. Among them, it is reported that some of such changes may appear in the heartbeat interval. In other words, by acquiring the driver's heartbeat interval in real time, it may be possible to detect the sudden changes, and reduce traffic accident. Even if a traffic accident occurs, the damage can be reduced by emergency evacuation immediately after detecting sudden changes. Therefore, we focused on the technology to detect the heartbeat interval with 24GHz microwave Doppler radar, which can detect heartbeat non-contactly while maintaining the interior design and passenger's privacy. Doppler radar with microwave is sensitive enough to detect heartbeat, however vibration noise is also superimposed on the sensor signal easily. Thus, in general algorithm studied widely, the problem is that the accuracy of detecting the heartbeat interval deteriorates particularly while driving, because the car vibration is superimposed on the frequency band used for heartbeat analysis, and the SNR (Signal to Noise power Ratio) decreases. To solve this problem, we developed an algorithm that extracts power spectrum over wide band including harmonic components of heartbeat and detects the peaks. This time, our new peak-searching method, in which multiple peak intervals are selected simultaneously based on the previous estimation results, suppresses false detection of peaks caused by vibration noise. As a result, the error rate of the heartbeat interval detection was reduced by half compared to the conventional algorithm in which a peak is detected based on previous heartbeat intervals.},

These can cause stress, pain, and also damage the fragile skin of the infants. It has been established previously that the colour and volume changes in superficial blood vessels during the cardiac cycle can be measured using a digital video camera and ambient light, making it possible to obtain estimates of heart rate or breathing rate. Most of the papers in the literature on non-contact vital sign monitoring report results on adult healthy human volunteers in controlled environments for short periods of time. The authors\&apos; current clinical study involves the continuous monitoring of pre-term infants, for at least four consecutive days each, in the high-dependency care area of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. The authors have further developed their video-based, non-contact monitoring methods to obtain continuous estimates of heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation for infants nursed in incubators. In this Letter, it is shown that continuous estimates of these three parameters can be computed with an accuracy which is clinically useful. During stable sections with minimal infant motion, the mean absolute error between the camera-derived estimates of heart rate and the reference value derived from the ECG is similar to the mean absolute error between the ECG-derived value and the heart rate value from a pulse oximeter. Continuous non-contact vital sign monitoring in the NICU using ambient light is feasible, and the authors have shown that clinically important events such as a bradycardia accompanied by a major desaturation can be identified with their algorithms for processing the video signal.},

Most patients requiring regular monitoring find the probes difficult to wear over prolonged periods of time. Research in non-contact vital sign monitoring has recently expanded through the use of off-the-shelf video cameras; nevertheless, most of the current work in video-based non-contact vital sign monitoring has so far been performed over short time periods (typically up to a couple of minutes), under tightly controlled conditions with relatively still and healthy volunteer subjects. Using an off-the-shelf camera, we have been able to compute estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate, and also detect changes in peripheral oxygen saturation in a real hospital scenario, without interfering with regular patient care. Videos were recorded for 369.1 hours from 40 patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment in the Renal Unit of the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, UK. The mean absolute error between the heart rate estimates from the camera and the average from two reference pulse oximeters (positioned at the finger and earlobe respectively) was 2.8 beats per minute for over 65\% of the time, which was comparable to the error between the two reference pulse oximeters. The mean absolute error between the respiratory rate estimates from the camera and the reference values (computed from the Electrocardiogram and a thoracic expansion sensor - chest belt) was 2.1 breaths per minute for over 69\% of the time for which the reference signals were valid. By calibrating the camera data with the reference pulse oximeters, changes in peripheral oxygen saturation could also be tracked during time periods with minimal patient motion.},

Intensive research is being conducted in this field with the goal of developing a "biometric driver seat". In this paper, an interferometric radar-based vital sign detection is presented. The aim is to investigate the applicability of radar technology for vital sign monitoring such as heartbeat and breath rate of the driver with sensors embedded in the seat.

Continuous wave (CW) radar systems enable contactless measurements of the vibrations on the human skin effected by heartbeats. Since a high accuracy as well as robustness of the measurement sensor is appreciated, the belonging signal processing routine has to deal with challenging requirements. In this paper, an advanced template matching (ATM) algorithm is proposed to enhance the performance regarding instantaneous heartbeat detection using CW radar systems. Compared to common template matching algorithms, multiple heterogeneous templates are utilized in this approach, at which the appropriate template type is determined by prior feature detection. A 24 Ghz Six-Port microwave interferometer is used for vital sign measurements of a person-under-test. The functionality of the proposed algorithm is verified by a synchronous reference electrocardiogram (ECG) and its enhancement is shown by reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the interbeat intervals (IBI) compared to an ordinary template matching algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces heart sound detection by radar systems, which enables touch-free and continuous monitoring of heart sounds. The proposed measurement principle entails two enhancements in modern vital sign monitoring. First, common touch-based auscultation with a phonocardiograph can be simplified by using biomedical radar systems. Second, detecting heart sounds offers a further feasibility in radar-based heartbeat monitoring. To analyse the performance of the proposed measurement principle, 9930 seconds of eleven persons-under-tests' vital signs were acquired and stored in a database using multiple, synchronised sensors: a continuous wave radar system, a phonocardiograph (PCG), an electrocardiograph (ECG), and a temperature-based respiration sensor. A hidden semi-Markov model is utilised to detect the heart sounds in the phonocardiograph and radar data and additionally, an advanced template matching (ATM) algorithm is used for state-of-the-art radar-based heartbeat detection. The feasibility of the proposed measurement principle is shown by a morphology analysis between the data acquired by radar and PCG for the dominant heart sounds S1 and S2: The correlation is 82.97 {$\pm$} 11.15\% for 5274 used occurrences of S1 and 80.72 {$\pm$} 12.16\% for 5277 used occurrences of S2. The performance of the proposed detection method is evaluated by comparing the F-scores for radar and PCG-based heart sound detection with ECG as reference: Achieving an F1 value of 92.22 {$\pm$} 2.07\%, the radar system approximates the score of 94.15 {$\pm$} 1.61\% for the PCG. The accuracy regarding the detection timing of heartbeat occurrences is analysed by means of the root-mean-square error: In comparison to the ATM algorithm (144.9 ms) and the PCG-based variant (59.4 ms), the proposed method has the lowest error value (44.2 ms). Based on these results, utilising the detected heart sounds considerably improves radar-based heartbeat monitoring, while the achieved performance is also competitive to phonocardiography.},

The proposed framework consists of four models: spatio-temporal representation learning, scene condition understanding, feature fusion, and drowsiness detection. Spatio-temporal representation learning extracts features that can describe motions and appearances in video simultaneously. Scene condition understanding classifies the scene conditions related to various conditions about the drivers and driving situations, such as statuses of wearing glasses, illumination condition of driving, and motion of facial elements, such as head, eye, and mouth. Feature fusion generates a condition-adaptive representation using two features extracted from the above models. The drowsiness detection model recognizes driver drowsiness status using the condition-adaptive representation. The condition-adaptive representation learning framework can extract more discriminative features focusing on each scene condition than the general representation so that the drowsiness detection method can provide more accurate results for the various driving situations. The proposed framework is evaluated with the NTHU drowsy driver detection video dataset. The experimental results show that our framework outperforms the existing drowsiness detection methods based on visual analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a real-time method based on various entropy and complexity measures for detection and identification of driving fatigue from recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram, and electrooculogram signals. The complexity features were used to distinguish whether the subjects are experienced drivers by calculating the Lempel-Ziv complexity of EEG approximate entropy (ApEn). Different threshold values can be set for the two kinds of drivers individually. The entropy-based features, namely, the wavelet entropy (WE), the peak-to-peak value of ApEn (PP-ApEn), and the peak-to-peak value of sample entropy (PP-SampEn), were extracted from the collected signals to estimate the driving fatigue stages. We proposed WE in a sliding window (WES), PP-ApEn in a sliding window (PP-ApEnS), and PP-SampEn in a sliding window (PP-SampEnS) for real-time analysis of driver fatigue. The real-time features obtained by WE, PP-ApEn, and PP-SampEn with sliding window were applied to artificial neural network for training and testing the system, which gives four situations for the fatigue level of the subjects, namely, normal state, mild fatigue, mood swing, and excessive fatigue. Then, the driver fatigue level can be determined in real time. The accuracy of estimation is about 96.5\%-99.5\%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to present the performance of the neural network classifier. The area under the ROC curve is 0.9931. The results show that the developed method is valuable for the application of avoiding some traffic accidents caused by driver's fatigue.},

Although many prediction models based on advanced machine learning techniques were proposed to monitor driver fatigue, especially in manual driving, little is known about how these black-box machine learning models work. In this paper, we proposed a combination of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to predict driver fatigue with explanations due to their efficiency and accuracy. First, in order to obtain the ground truth of driver fatigue, PERCLOS (percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time) between 0 and 100 was used as the response variable. Second, we built a driver fatigue regression model using both physiological and behavioral measures with XGBoost and it outperformed other selected machine learning models with 3.847 root-mean-squared error (RMSE), 1.768 mean absolute error (MAE) and 0.996 adjusted \$R\^2\$. Third, we employed SHAP to identify the most important predictor variables and uncovered the black-box XGBoost model by showing the main effects of most important predictor variables globally and explaining individual predictions locally. Such an explainable driver fatigue prediction model offered insights into how to intervene in automated driving when necessary, such as during the takeover transition period from automated driving to manual driving.},
